                    <strong>   Objective</strong>: Cricket is a team sport played between two teams. The objective is to score more runs than the opposing team while batting and to dismiss all their batsmen while fielding.<br>

<stong>Players</stong> A cricket team typically consists of 11 players, with each team taking turns to bat and field. The team that is batting is known as the "batting side," and the team that is fielding is the "bowling side."
<br>

<strong>Batting</strong>: Batsmen attempt to score runs by hitting the ball bowled by the opposition's bowlers and running between two sets of wooden stumps, called "wickets," which are placed at either end of a 22-yard-long pitch. They can also score runs by hitting the ball to the boundary rope (a four or six).
<br>
<strong>Bowling</strong>: The bowler's objective is to dismiss the batsmen by getting them out through various means, such as bowling them out, getting them caught by fielders, or having them declared out through various cricket rules. There are different formats of cricket, including:<br>
<br>
<strong>Test Cricket</strong>: This is the longest format of the game, lasting up to five days, with each team having two innings. It is known for its strategic depth and is often considered the purest form of the game.<br>
<Strong>One day</Strong>: In this format, each team is limited to 50 overs to bat and bowl.T20 is the shortest format of the game, with each team allowed 20 overs to bat and bowl. It is known for its fast-paced and entertaining nature.
Governing Bodies: The International Cricket Council (ICC) is the global governing body for cricket. It oversees international matches and tournaments, including the Cricket World Cup and various Test and T20 leagues.<br>

<strong>Famous Tournaments</strong>: Some of the most well-known cricket tournaments include the ICC Cricket World Cup, the ICC T20 World Cup, The Ashes (a Test series between England and Australia), the Indian Premier League (IPL), and various domestic leagues in different countries.<br>

<strong>Cricketing Legends</strong>: Over the years, cricket has seen many legendary players, such as Sachin Tendulkar, Sir Don Bradman, Sir Vivian Richards, Sir Garfield Sobers, and many more, who have left an indelible mark on the sport.<br>

<strong>Spirit</strong>: Cricket places a strong emphasis on sportsmanship and fair play. It is often referred to as the "gentleman's game."<br>

<sTRong>Popularity</sTRong>: Cricket is one of the most popular sports in the world, particularly in countries like India, where it's almost a religion, and in England and Australia, where it has a rich history.<br>
